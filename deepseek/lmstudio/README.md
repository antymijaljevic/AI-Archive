# LLM Studio

LLM Studio (or LLM-Studio) is a software tool designed specifically for working with language models. While LLMs are trained using parameters rather than raw data, LLM Studio provides APIs and frameworks that make it easier for developers to integrate LLMs into their applications. Key features include:

- **APIs** for interacting with LLMs.
- Pre-built models and templates for integrating LLMs into projects.
- Support for deployment on edge devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables).
- Integration with Python-based frameworks.

LLM Studio simplifies the process of working with LLMs by providing a user-friendly interface and built-in tools for common use cases. It is particularly useful for deploying models directly from pre-trained parameters rather than performing inference on raw data.
